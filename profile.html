    HEY YOU!

        Alright, jerks, sit down. This story begins in the month of March, when my AWESOME Dad and my AWESOME Mom (sorta cool too but she makes me clean my room, which is super <i class="vaporwave">annoying</i>. I mean, c'mon Mom, I am 12 years old, geez) gave birth to <i class="awesome">Me</i>. When I emerged from the womb, I was holding the face of a <b>dead primordial god</b> which I had taken when I emerged <i class="awesome">victorious</i> from my unholy struggle against the <b>dark lords of time</b>. Since then I have been learning how to hack computer systems all over the <i class="awesome">United States Military Network</i>. In short I am not the kind of <i class="awesome"> dude</i> you want to mess with, and definately not bully, "Garret" (That is a stupid name by the way)
